Saying \"either A or B or C\" will annoy\nand distract some readers, but if it's the best phrasing for your situation,\nthen use it.\n  element (for XML and HTML elements) (not tag)\n  HTML 4 elements are often referred to as \"tags,\" but the equivalent items\nin modern HTML and XML are officially known as \"elements.\"\n  email (not \"e-mail\" or \"Email\" or \"E-mail\")\n  As of mid-2017, Merriam-Webster dictionaries still prefer \"e-mail\" to\n\"email.\" But the AP style manual switched to \"email\" in March 2011, and the\nNew York Times switched to \"email\" in October 2013.\n  In some contexts, \"mail\" may be a better choice.\n  emoji\n  Use \"emoji\" for both singular and plural forms.

For\nexample, a Task\nresource has properties like kind, id, and\ntitle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  quota\n  In API contexts, usually refers to API usage limits. Best to use the\nphrase \"usage limit\" instead (except in cases where \"quota\" appears in a UI),\nbecause the word \"quota\" means many different things to many different\npeople.\n\n\n\n\n  realtime (not \"real time\" or \"real-time\", whether or not\nused as a modifier)\n   recents screen (not\n\"overview screen\")\n  Representational State Transfer\n  Don't use. To people unfamiliar with REST, this acronym expansion is\nmeaningless; better to just refer to it as REST and don't bother trying to\nexplain what it theoretically stands for.\n  review\n  If you mean \"read, potentially for the first time,\" then use \"read\"\ninstead of \"review.\" Of course, if you mean \"read critically, commenting on\nproblems\" (as in \"code review\"), then \"review\" is fine; the usage to avoid is\nphrasing like \"If you've never heard of OAuth, then review the OAuth\ndocumentation.\"\n  runbook (not \"run book\")\n  runtime (not \"run time\")\n\n\n\n\n  screenshot (not \"screen shot\")\n  Search (noun); search (verb)\n  Search Console\n  select\n  Use to describe choosing an item from among multiple options, selecting\ntext, or marking a checkbox.\n  Not recommended: Check\nAutomatically check for updates.\n  Recommended: Select Automatically\ncheck for updates.\n\n\n\n  service\n  In our API documentation, a \"service\" is a Google product, such as Google\nCalendar or Google Books.\n  setup (noun or adjective); set up (verb)\n  SHA-1\n  Not \"SHA1,\" except in string literals/enums and in hyphenated phrases\nsuch as \"HSA-SHA1.\"\n  should\n  Generally avoid.\n  When telling the reader what to do, \"should\" implies recommended but\noptional, which leaves the reader unsure of what to do. Better to use \"must\" or\njust leave out the word \"should.\"\n  When telling the reader what \"should\" happen:\n    \n      If the event that should happen doesn't happen, the reader is left\nwondering whether something has gone wrong. In this case, leave out the word\n\"should\" so that the reader knows that something has gone wrong if the event\ndoesn't happen.\n      In most contexts, it's hard for the reader to tell who should cause\nthe situation to come about. For example, if a reference document says \"The\nvalue should be true or false,\" does that mean \"You must set the value to either\ntrue or false\" or \"The server sets the value to either true or false\"? Also,\n\"should be\" can suggest that it won't necessarily be; what happens if it isn't?\nSo try to rephrase to be more precise about who should do\nwhat.\n    \n  \n  Not recommended: The Classroom Share\nButton should conform to our min-max size guidelines and related color/button\ntemplates.\n  Recommended: Ensure that the\nClassroom Share Button conforms to our min-max size guidelines and related\ncolor/button templates.\n  Not recommended: The column of the\ndata table that the filter should operate on.\n  Recommended: The column of the data\ntable that the filter operates on.\n  Not recommended: Whether it's a brand\nnew project or an existing one, here's what you should do.\n  Recommended: Whether it's a brand new\nproject or an existing one, perform the following steps.\n\n  sign-in (noun or adjective); sign in (verb)\n  sign-on; sign on\n  Don't use either form on its own. Use the hyphenated version as part of\n\"single sign-on.\"\n  since\n  If you mean \"because,\" then use \"because\" instead of \"since.\" \"Since\"\ndeals with the passage of time and \"because\" deals with causation or the reason\nfor something.\n  simple\n  single most (not \"singlemost\")\n  single sign-on (noun or adjective)\n  smartphone\n  Don't use. Instead, use \"mobile phone\" or\n\"phone.\"\n  ssh and SSH\n  To refer to the terminal tool ssh (used for creating a\nsecure terminal connection), use lowercase, both for noun and verb: \"use\nssh to connect to your remote shell\" or \"Then ssh into your remote\nshell.\"\n  \"SSH\" (uppercase) can refer more generally to a secure communications\nprotocol, such as for running commands in a remote shell environment over\nsecure connections, for tunneling, or for port forwarding.\n  ssh'ing\n  Use alternatives to \"ssh'ing\" unless there is just no way around it.\n  Recommended: ... connect/connecting\nvia SSH.\n  Recommended: ... use/using SSH to\nconnect/forward/tunnel/log in.\n  status bar\n  style sheet (not \"stylesheet\")\n  This is the official spelling, per the World Wide Web Consortium\n(W3C).\n  subclass (not sub-class; noun or verb)\n  sub-element\n  subtree (not \"sub-tree\")\n\n\n\n\n  tab\n  When referring to the sub-pages of the API\nConsole, use \"page\" instead of \"tab\".\n  tablet\n  \"Tablet\" is OK. If you don't know whether it's a tablet or a phone, use\n\"device.\"\n   tap\n  Use for onscreen and soft (capacitive) buttons. For mechanical buttons,\nuse \"press.\"\n  Use instead of \"touch.\"  However, \"touch & hold\" (not \"touch and hold\")\nis OK to use. (Note the \"&\". It's OK to use in this case.)\n   \"tap &\nhold\" or \"tap and hold\"\n  Use \"touch & hold\" (not \"touch and hold\") instead. (Note the \"&\". It's OK\nto use in this case.)\n  target\n  Avoid using as a verb when possible, especially in reference to people.\nFor some readers, may have aggressive connotations. Instead of \"targeting\"\naudiences, we should try to attract them or appeal to them or make their lives\neasier. (Using it as an adjective, as in \"target audience,\" is probably fine.)\nAlternatives include terms such as \"intended for,\" \"looking for,\" \"focused on,\"\nand \"interacting with.\"\n  terminate\n  Don't use. Instead, use words like stop, exit, cancel, or end.\n  they (singular)\n  This is our preferred gender-neutral pronoun. Whether used as singular\nor plural, it always takes the plural verb. For example, \"A user authenticates\nthat they are who they say they are by entering their password.\" See also gender-neutral he.\n  their (singular)\n  this, that\n  Where possible, put a noun after \"this\" or \"that\" for clarity. If doing\nso results in clunky prose, then don't do it; but even then, try thinking about\nwhat the noun would be. If you aren't sure what noun \"this\" or \"that\" refers\nto, then consider rephrasing.\n  timeframe (not \"time frame\")\n  Avoid where possible, or use an alternative such as \"period,\" \"schedule,\"\n\"deadline,\" or \"when.\" But if you do use it, write it without a space in the\nmiddle.\n  timestamp (not \"time stamp\")\n  timeout (noun), time out (verb)\n  time zone (noun), time-zone (adjective)\n   touch\n  Don't use. Instead, use \"tap.\" However, \"touch & hold\" is OK to use.\n  touchscreen (not \"touch screen\")\n  typically\n  Use to describe what is usual or expected under normal circumstances.\nDon't use as the first word in a sentence, as doing so can leave the meaning\nopen to misinterpretation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Unix-like\n  uncheck\n  Don't use to refer to clearing a check mark from a checkbox. Instead, use\n\"clear.\"\n  Not recommended: Uncheck\nAutomatically check for updates.\n  Not recommended: Deselect\nAutomatically check for updates.\n  Recommended: Clear Automatically\ncheck for updates.\n  unselect\n  Don't use.\n  URL\n  All caps. Plural is \"URLs.\"\n  Write \"a URL\" rather than \"an URL\", because the most common pronunciation\nstarts with a consonant sound. For more information, see a and\nan.\n  user base (not \"userbase\")\n  username (not \"user name\")\n\n\n\n\n  vs.\n  Don't use \"vs.\" as an abbreviation for \"versus\"; instead, use the\nunabbreviated \"versus.\"\n  voila\n  Don't use.\n\n\n\n\n  wake lock (noun), wake-lock (adjective)\n  walkthrough (not \"walk-through\")\n\n\n\n\n\n  web (lowercase)\n  web page\n  Not \"webpage.\" But where possible, avoid both by using \"page.\"\n  website (lowercase w; not \"web site\")\n  whether\n  To decide whether it's more appropriate to use \"if\" or \"whether,\"\nsee \nGrammar Girl's discussion of \"If\" Versus \"Whether\".\n    To decide if you need to add \"or not\" when using \"whether,\" see the\nNew York Times's blog post about whether (or not).\n  whitespace (not \"white space\")\n  Wi-Fi (not \"wifi\" or \"WiFi\")\n  When possible, instead use \"wireless.\"\n  with\n  Don't use with when expressing ownership:\n  Not recommended: A handset with 2 GB\nof RAM.\n  Recommended: A handset that has 2 GB\nof RAM.\n  Don't use with when expressing use:\n  Not recommended: Debug this tool with\nthe debugging tool.\n  Recommended: Use the debugging tool\nto debug.\n  World Wide Web\n  Don't use.
