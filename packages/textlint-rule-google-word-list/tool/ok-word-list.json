For example,\n\"metaprogramming\" and \"metalanguage\" have no hyphens.\n  MIME type\n  \"MIME\" stands for \"Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions,\" and thus\nrefers specifically to email.

For\nexample, a Task\nresource has properties like kind, id, and\ntitle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  quota\n  In API contexts, usually refers to API usage limits. Best to use the\nphrase \"usage limit\" instead (except in cases where \"quota\" appears in a UI),\nbecause the word \"quota\" means many different things to many different\npeople.\n\n\n\n\n  realtime (not \"real time\" or \"real-time\", whether or not\nused as a modifier)\n   recents screen (not\n\"overview screen\")\n  Representational State Transfer\n  Don't use. To people unfamiliar with REST, this acronym expansion is\nmeaningless; better to just refer to it as REST and don't bother trying to\nexplain what it theoretically stands for.\n  review\n  If you mean \"read, potentially for the first time,\" then use \"read\"\ninstead of \"review.\" Of course, if you mean \"read critically, commenting on\nproblems\" (as in \"code review\"), then \"review\" is fine; the usage to avoid is\nphrasing like \"If you've never heard of OAuth, then review the OAuth\ndocumentation.\"\n  runbook (not \"run book\")\n  runtime (not \"run time\")\n\n\n\n\n  screenshot (not \"screen shot\")\n  Search (noun); search (verb)\n  Search Console\n  select\n  Use to describe choosing an item from among multiple options, selecting\ntext, or marking a checkbox.\n  Not recommended: Check\nAutomatically check for updates.\n  Recommended: Select Automatically\ncheck for updates.\n\n\n\n  service\n  In our API documentation, a \"service\" is a Google product, such as Google\nCalendar or Google Books.\n  setup (noun or adjective); set up (verb)\n  SHA-1\n  Not \"SHA1,\" except in string literals/enums and in hyphenated phrases\nsuch as \"HSA-SHA1.\"\n  should\n  Generally avoid.\n  When telling the reader what to do, \"should\" implies recommended but\noptional, which leaves the reader unsure of what to do. Better to use \"must\" or\njust leave out the word \"should.\"\n  When telling the reader what \"should\" happen:\n    \n      If the event that should happen doesn't happen, the reader is left\nwondering whether something has gone wrong. In this case, leave out the word\n\"should\" so that the reader knows that something has gone wrong if the event\ndoesn't happen.\n      In most contexts, it's hard for the reader to tell who should cause\nthe situation to come about. For example, if a reference document says \"The\nvalue should be true or false,\" does that mean \"You must set the value to either\ntrue or false\" or \"The server sets the value to either true or false\"?
